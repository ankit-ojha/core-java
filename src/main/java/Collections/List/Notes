A List is an ordered Collection (sometimes called a sequence).
Lists may contain duplicate elements.
Elements can be inserted or accessed by their position in the list, using a zero-based index.

--------------------------------------------ARRAYLIST-------------------------------------------------------------------

Definition
- ArrayList is a class that implements List interface
- It uses an array to implement a list, hence the name arraylist
- ArrayList size can grow and shrink dynamically, hence it has advantage over Arrays
- Not thread-safe hence should not be used in the multi threaded environment

- Initialization

1. ArrayList<Type> obj = new ArrayList<Type>(Arrays.asList(Object o1, Object o2, Object o3, ....so on));
2. ArrayList<T> obj = new ArrayList<T>(){{
   		   add(Object o1);
   		   add(Object o2);
   		   add(Object o3);
                      ...
                      ...
   		   }};
3. ArrayList<T> obj = new ArrayList<T>();
   	   obj.add("Object o1");
   	   obj.add("Object o2");
   	   obj.add("Object o3");
                           ...
                           ...
4. ArrayList<T> obj = new ArrayList<T>(Collections.nCopies(count, element));
ArrayList<Integer> intlist = new ArrayList<Integer>(Collections.nCopies(10, 5));
Output:: [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]

- Looping

1.  for (int counter = 0; counter < arrlist.size(); counter++) {
             System.out.println(arrlist.get(counter));
    }
2. for (Integer num : arrlist) {
              System.out.println(num);
    }
3. while (arrlist.size() > count) {
   	 System.out.println(arrlist.get(count));
            count++;
   }
4. Iterator iter = arrlist.iterator();
         while (iter.hasNext()) {
          System.out.println(iter.next());
  }
5. Enumeration<String> e = Collections.enumeration(arrayList);
while(e.hasMoreElements())
      System.out.println(e.nextElement());


- Synchronization
1. List<String> syncal = Collections.synchronizedList(new ArrayList<String>());
    synchronized(syncal) {
           Iterator<String> iterator = syncal.iterator();
           while (iterator.hasNext())
              System.out.println(iterator.next());
           }
2. CopyOnWriteArrayList : thread-safe variant of ArrayList
CopyOnWriteArrayList<String> al = new CopyOnWriteArrayList<String>();

- Sorting of ArrayList<Object> is done using Comparable Interface (implements Comparable interface and override compareTo() and toString())
- Swapping using Collections.swap(l1, 1, 5);
- ArrayList is Serializable by default
- Combine two arraylist using addAll
- Cloning is done using clone()    a2 = a1.clone() a2 will not get affected even if a1 elements are altered
- Empty using clear()/removeAll() : a1.clear();
- Check if a list if empty using isEmpty()
- ensureCapacity(10) to increase the capacity of ArrayList
- Length of ArrayList using size()

--------------------------------------------LINKED LIST-----------------------------------------------------------------

- LinkedList is a linear data structure
- It extends both List & Queue
- They are not stored as Arrays, they are linked with each other using pointers
- Each element of the LinkedList has a reference (address/pointers) to the next element of the linked list
- Each element is called a node. A node has 2 information (Contents of the element and address/reference/pointers to next node
- Last node points to null as an address/reference
- Head of the LinkedList only contains the Address of the First element of the List.
- Doubly linked list contains 3 parts. It has address of the last and the next node, in addition to its own content
- It allows dynamic memory allocation
- Looping same way (4 ways) as ArrayList
- ListIterator listIt = linkedlist.listIterator(); (Ensure both direction iterating using hasNext()/next() and hasPrevious()/previous())
- Convert a LinkedList to ArrayList using  List<String> list = new ArrayList<String>(linkedlist);
- Convert a LinkedList to Array using String[] array = linkedlist.toArray(new String[linkedlist.size()]);
- push("element"): insert an element at the front of the list [list.push("NEW ELEMENT");]
- pop(): remove an element and returns the element [list.pop()]
- peek : Retrieves, but does not remove, the head (first element) of this list.
- peekFirst(): Retrieves, but does not remove, the first element of this list, or returns null if this list is empty.
- peekLast(): Retrieves, but does not remove, the last element of this list, or returns null if this list is empty.
- poll() - Same as peek but it removes


---------------------------------- ArrayList Vs LinkedList -------------------------------------------------------------

1. Search
ArrayList is faster O(1) than LinkedList O(n) as ArrayList maintains an index based search using array data structure implicitly.
LinkedList implements doubly linked list which requires traversal through all the elements for searching an element

2. Deletion
LinkedList is faster than ArrayList [Best Case O(1) when removing last element and Worst case O(n) for removing first element]
As ArrayList needs to be shifted to fill out the space created by deleted element
LinkedList only requires to change the address of two neighbouring elements. Hence it's faster

3. Insertion
Same as Deletion

4. Memory
High in LinkedList as it contains element data and two pointers for neighbour nodes

LinkedList should be used when you want to perform data manipulation, while ArrayList should be used when you want to store the data and access it

-------------------------------------- ArrayList Vs Vector -------------------------------------------------------------

1. Synchronization
> Not Vs Is
ArrayList is not sync while Vector is

2. Resize

> Half Vs Double
Both ArrayList and Vector can grow and shrink dynamically to maintain the optimal use of storage, however the way they resized is different.
ArrayList grow by half of its size when resized while Vector doubles the size of itself by default when grows.

3. Performance

AL: Better (as it is not sync)

4. Fail-Fast

AL is Fail Fast and Vector is not

-------------------------------------- ArrayList Vs HashMap ------------------------------------------------------------

1. Implementation
> AL uses List Interface and HashMap used Map Interface

2. Memory
Low Vs High
> AL uses element value alone and maintains internally the index of each element
> HM stores key and value pair (both), hence more memory

3. Order
> Insertion Order Vs No Order

4. Duplicates
> Allows Vs Not

5. Nulls
> Any Number of nulls Vs One null key with any number of null values
