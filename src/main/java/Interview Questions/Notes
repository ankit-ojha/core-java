- Java is not 100% Object-oriented because it makes use of eight primitive data types such as boolean, byte, char, int, float, double, long, short
which are not objects.

- Singleton class is a class whose only one instance can be created at any given time, in one JVM.
A class can be made singleton by making its constructor private.

- The Java ClassLoader is a subset of JVM (Java Virtual Machine) that is responsible for loading the class files.
Whenever a Java program is executed it is first loaded by the classloader. Java provides three built-in classloaders:

  Bootstrap ClassLoader
  Extension ClassLoader
  System/Application ClassLoader

- A Marker interface can be defined as the interface having no data member and member functions.
In simpler terms, an empty interface is called the Marker interface. The most common examples of Marker interface in Java are Serializable, Cloneable etc.
Marker interface is used as a tag to inform a message to the Java compiler so that it can add special behaviour to the class implementing it.
Java marker interface has no members in it.
From java 1.5, the need for marker interface is eliminated by the introduction of the java annotation feature.
