The process by which one class acquires the properties(data members) and functionalities(methods) of another class is called inheritance.
The aim of inheritance is to provide the re-usability of code so that a class has to write only the unique features and rest of the common properties and functionalities can be extended from the another class.
Child Class extends Parent Class
Types of Inheritance

- Single Inheritance [A->B]
- Multiple Level Inheritance [A->B->C]
- Hierarchy Inheritance [A->B A->C A->D]
- Java does not support Multiple Inheritance as it will run into diamond problem (Ambiguity to use which method)
