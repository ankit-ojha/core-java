- Object is an instance of a class
- A class is a logical entity that can be considered as a template/blueprint using which you can create as many objects as you like.
- A class is a blueprint for the object. Before we create an object, we first need to define the class.
- We can think of the class as a sketch (prototype) of a house.
It contains all the details about the floors, doors, windows, etc. Based on these descriptions we build the house. House is the object.
Since many houses can be made from the same description, we can create many objects from a class.
