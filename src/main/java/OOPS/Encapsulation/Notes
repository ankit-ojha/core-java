- Encapsulation simply means binding object state(fields) and behavior(methods) together.
If you are creating class, you are doing encapsulation.
- The whole idea behind encapsulation is to hide the implementation details from users.
- Wrapping data (variables) and behavior(methods) to act as a single unit


- How to make an encapsulated class
1. Make Instance variables private
2. Have getter setter methods public

- It is also known as data hiding as the member variables are private and cannot be accessed from outside class
- You can create read only and/or write only classes by providing either getter and/or setter methods


------------------------------------ ENCAPSULATION VS ABSTRACTION ------------------------------------------------------

- Encapsulation wraps data and methods into single unit to secure the data from outside world
Vs Abstraction allows you to focus on what the object does instead of how it does it
- Implementation Level Vs Design Level
- Implemented Using Access Modifiers Vs Implemented Using Abstract Class and Interface
- How it should be done Vs What should be done
