Polymorphism is an important concept of object-oriented programming. It simply means more than one form.
That is, the same entity (method or operator or object) can perform different operations in different scenarios.
Polymorphism allows you define one interface and have multiple implementations.


Types of Polymorphism

1. Compile Time | Overloading | Static
2. Run Time | Overriding | Dynamic
