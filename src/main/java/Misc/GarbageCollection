------------------------------------------ GARBAGE COLLECTION ----------------------------------------------------------

The process of removing unused objects from heap memory is known as Garbage collection and this is a part of memory management in Java.
'Garbage Collector' is best example of daemon thread as it is always running in the background
Main objective is to free up heap memory by destroying unreachable objects
Just before destroying an object, Garbage Collector calls finalize() method on the object to perform cleanup activities.
Once finalize() method completes, Garbage Collector destroys that object.
GC collects only those objects which are created by new keyword


When?
1. When object is no longer reachable
Student student = new Student();
student = null;

2. When one reference is copied to another reference
Student student1 = new Student();
Student student2 = new Student();
student1 = student2;

3. Anonymous Objects
new Student();

How?

1. Explicit (There is no guarantee that GC will run)
System.gc()
Runtime.getRuntime().gc()

2. Implicit
Automatically
